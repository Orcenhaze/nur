
Features:
- Displaying layered cutscenes (HH E.221).
- Simple package manager.
- Simple instrumentation.

Improvements:
- Store save.dat file in AppData or Saved Games folder on Windows.

Level design:
- Explain mirrors, benders and splitters in terms of horizontal/vertical and diagonal reflection.
- Fix bender_red and bender_locked_red. If we explain rules well, we don't need to duplicate.
- If all primary colored lasers are present in same level, it's possible to make white before player is introduced to the concept.
- Design more hard levels.
- Levels where we don't render objs and force player to solve the puzzle blindly (maybe keep particles).

Art:
- Layered cutscenes.
- Writing: plot, dialogues and monologues.
- Sound effects and ambient sounds.
- Shadows?


About instrumentation:
Implement simple CYCLE_COUNT_SCOPE() macro for instrumentation using _rdtsc().

About simple package manager:
Null-terminate strings when writing to files + establish convention.
Don't load stuff from disk, allocate more memory, then copy. Instead, load stuff from disk, and simply point stuff into it, no need to copy. Once we load a package into memory, it should stay in memory for the lifetime of the program.

Misc:
Precompile hlsl shaders using fxc (look at how wcap does it).



Make it good.
Make it fast.
