
Features:
- Displaying layered cutscenes (HH E.221).
* Simple package manager.
- Simple instrumentation.

Improvements:
- Create separate input array for per-frame inputs and pull out UI code to update_and_render every frame.
* Store save.dat file in AppData or Saved Games folder on Windows.
* Thank you screen.
* Background art + audio.

* Level design:
- Explain mirrors, benders and splitters in terms of horizontal/vertical and diagonal reflection.
- Design more hard levels.
- Levels where we don't render objs and force player to solve the puzzle blindly (maybe keep particles).
- Connected levels...

Art:
- Layered cutscenes.
- Writing: plot, dialogues and monologues.
* Better sound effects.
- Shadows?


About instrumentation:
Implement simple CYCLE_COUNT_SCOPE() macro for instrumentation using _rdtsc().

About simple package manager:
Null-terminate strings when writing to files + establish convention.
Don't load stuff from disk, allocate more memory, then copy. Instead, load stuff from disk, and simply point stuff into it, no need to copy. Once we load a package into memory, it should stay in memory for the lifetime of the program.

Misc:
Precompile hlsl shaders using fxc (look at how wcap does it).



Make it good.
Make it fast.
