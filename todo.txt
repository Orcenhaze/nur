Playtesting.

- Explain mirrors, benders and splitters in terms of horizontal/vertical and diagonal reflection.
- Fix bender_red and bender_locked_red. If we explain rules well, we don't need to duplicate.
- If all primary colored lasers are present in same level, it's possible to make white before player is introduced to the concept.

Rename is_loading_level to something more accurate and if we restart level, set it to false and transition timer to 0.
Make levels store index instead of level name.

More hard levels.
Overworld/(level select) and plot.

Simple package manager.
Null-terminate strings when writing to files + convention.
Don't load stuff from disk, allocate more memory, then copy. Instead, load stuff from disk, and simply point stuff into it, no need to copy. Once we load a package into memory, it should stay in memory for the lifetime of the program.



Precompile hlsl shaders using fxc (look at how wcap does it).



Make it good.
Make it fast.
